# Contributing to PhilEO

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PhilEO, the toolbox for AI-driven analysis of Copernicus data developed by the ESA Î¦-lab. Your contributions are essential for making PhilEO more efficient, feature-rich, and accessible to the community. This document will guide you through the process of contributing to the PhilEO project.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure you have a GitHub account and are familiar with the use of Git for version control. Familiarity with the PyTorch library and experience in working with Copernicus data are also beneficial but not strictly required.

### Quick Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**: Go to the [PhilEO GitHub repository](https://github.com/ESA-PhiLab/PhilEO) and click on the "Fork" button. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PhilEO.git
   cd PhilEO
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Before making your changes, create a new branch in your local repository. This helps in isolating your changes and makes the review process more efficient.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your_feature_name
   ```

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Please refer to the `README.md` file in the PhilEO repository for instructions on setting up your development environment. This will include steps for installing PyTorch and other dependencies.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, and robust code. Follow the coding standards and conventions established in the project.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Include comments in your code where necessary and update the documentation to reflect your changes, especially if you're adding new features or changing existing functionality.

### Submitting Your Contributions

1. **Push Your Changes**: Once you have made your changes, push your branch to your fork on GitHub.

   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your_feature_name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original PhilEO repository on GitHub, and you'll see a prompt to create a pull request from your new branch. Fill in the details about your changes, why they're needed, and any other relevant information.

3. **Code Review**: After submitting your pull request, the project maintainers will review your changes. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make further adjustments based on the review.

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements

- **Use GitHub Issues**: To report a bug or suggest an enhancement, please use the GitHub Issues section of the PhilEO repository. Before creating a new issue, check to see if an issue already exists for your bug or suggestion.

- **Provide Detailed Information**: When reporting a bug, include as much information as possible, such as steps to reproduce the bug, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome. For enhancements, describe the proposed feature or improvement and its potential benefits.

## Community Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community, whether it's in the form of code, bug reports, feature suggestions, or documentation improvements. Your contributions will help make PhilEO a more powerful tool for everyone working with Copernicus data.
